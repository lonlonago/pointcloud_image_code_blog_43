#  First, the principle of the algorithm 

   The core principle of the algorithm is still the suspicion of RANSAC fitting space. For the specific theory, please refer to: Open3D - RANSAC three-dimensional point cloud space straight line fitting. Just slightly modify the code to make it suitable for dividing multiple straight lines in point cloud data.
