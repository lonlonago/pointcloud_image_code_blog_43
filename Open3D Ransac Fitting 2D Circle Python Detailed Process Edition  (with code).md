#  First, the principle of the algorithm 

   RANSAC fitting circle generally uses three-point fixed circle, but the derivation of the three-point fixed circle calculation formula is too complicated (see: three-point fixed circle derivation formula). Therefore, the method of calculating the circumscribed circle of the triangle is used instead (see: PCL calculates the center and radius of the circumscribed circle of the plane triangle), and the effect is equivalent.
