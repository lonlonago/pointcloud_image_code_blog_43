   A point cloud is a collection of scattered points in space that represents the characteristic information of the surface contour of an object. Point cloud slicing is to use a set of planes to intersect the point cloud. Given a plane, a point cloud, find the contour line in the plane. Since the density of the point cloud is limited, it is not feasible to use the points in the plane to find the contour line. Therefore, the "bandwidth" is introduced, and the contour curve of the plane is generated by generating two equidistant plane sums in the normal vector direction. The distance between and is the bandwidth, and the bandwidth is the slice thickness. The point cloud slicing model is shown in the figure.

   First, three points that are not collinear are selected from the point cloud, and then a plane is fitted according to the three points, and this plane is used as the tangent plane of the point cloud slice. As shown in the figure below:
